	"Appearence. This code attempts to show the following:
		- a currently loaded version of the package: underlined.
		- a version of a not loaded package: bold.
		- a newer version of a loaded package: bold.
		- a version not in the ancestry of the currently loaded and
		selected package: bold.
	All those tests are made on the version name and number, not the package
	UUID, so they are not reliable. The least reliable test is the 'newer' check.
