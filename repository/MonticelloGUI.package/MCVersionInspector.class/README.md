I am a tool that visually represents an MCVersion. 

While I can be opened on anMCVersion, you've probably seen me most often after saving a package in the Monticello Browser. 

I have buttons to perform common version-related actions - like browsing, loading, and viewing changes. In my main text area, I display the following information about my version - name, author, timestamp, UUID, ancestors and log message.
